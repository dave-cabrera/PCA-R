# Principal component analysis using R.

The data 'Star_sample.xlsx' contains information about 1,000 stars. Using the data of the stars' ascension, declination, magnitude from Earth, absolute magnitude,
and log distance from Earth, I used principal component analysis to group the stars together based on their similarities.
